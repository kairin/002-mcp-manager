# Specification Quality Checklist: CI/CD Pipeline Improvements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
✅ Specification focuses entirely on user needs and business value
✅ No frameworks, languages, or implementation details mentioned
✅ Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are fully specified
✅ All 16 functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria
✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (time, percentages, counts)
✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "pipeline duration reduces by 40-60%" not "use GNU parallel for test execution")
✅ Each user story includes detailed acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
✅ Edge cases section identifies 8 boundary conditions and error scenarios
✅ Scope clearly bounded to enhancements of existing Feature 001 CI/CD pipeline
✅ Dependencies implicit (requires existing Feature 001 infrastructure)

### Feature Readiness - PASS
✅ Each of 16 functional requirements maps directly to acceptance scenarios in user stories
✅ 9 prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) cover all enhancement areas comprehensively
✅ Success criteria are measurable and directly related to target outcomes:
  - SC-001: 100% timeout enforcement (FR-001, FR-002)
  - SC-002: 0 silent failures (FR-003, FR-004)
  - SC-003: 40-60% faster tests (FR-005, FR-006)
  - SC-004: 70% faster debugging (FR-007)
  - SC-005: Real-time progress updates (FR-008, FR-009)
  - SC-006: 100% correlation accuracy (FR-010, FR-011)
  - SC-007: 80% fewer false failures (FR-012, FR-013)
  - SC-008: 100% constitution detection (FR-014, FR-015)
  - SC-009: 50% fewer false positives (FR-016)
✅ Zero implementation leakage (no mention of bash background jobs, jq parsing, specific exit codes implementation)

## Notes

All validation items passed on first iteration. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

**Strengths**:
- Excellent prioritization with 9 independently testable user stories
- Clear mapping from functional requirements to success criteria
- Comprehensive edge case identification
- Precise, measurable success criteria with specific percentages and thresholds
- Technology-agnostic throughout (no implementation details)

**Ready for next phase**: ✅ Yes

2. âœ… Ambiguity Detection - Scanned for vague language and placeholders
3. âœ… Underspecification Detection - Verified measurable outcomes exist
4. âœ… Constitution Alignment - Validated compliance with 8 principles
5. âœ… Coverage Gap Analysis - Verified all requirements have tasks
6. âœ… Inconsistency Detection - Checked terminology and ordering

---

## Detailed Findings

### ðŸŸ¢ PASS: Duplication Detection

**Status**: No significant duplication found

**Analysis**:
- Exit code contract (0-5) appears in 3 locations by design:
  - spec.md (requirements FR-001, FR-002)
  - contracts/exit-codes.md (full specification)
  - tasks.md (Phase 2, T005)
  - **Verdict**: âœ… Valid - contract needs distribution for reference

- Parallel test execution described in:
  - spec.md (User Story 3, FR-005, FR-006)
  - research.md (Decision #3)
  - tasks.md (Phase 5, T021-T027)
  - **Verdict**: âœ… Valid - different levels of detail (what vs. how)

**Recommendation**: No action required

---

### ðŸŸ¢ PASS: Ambiguity Detection

**Status**: 1 low-priority enhancement opportunity

**Analysis**:
- All 17 functional requirements use precise, testable language
- Success criteria include specific metrics (percentages, thresholds)
- User story acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases documented with clear handling instructions

**Minor Enhancement** (Low Priority):
- **Finding**: research.md Decision #3 uses "typically" for parallel test speedup
  - "typically achieves 40-60% reduction"
  - **Risk**: Low - success criterion SC-003 has exact threshold
  - **Suggestion**: Add min/max bounds for typical vs. exceptional cases
  - **Location**: research.md:145-160

**Recommendation**: Accept as-is or clarify in quickstart.md during implementation

---

### ðŸŸ¢ PASS: Underspecification Detection

**Status**: All requirements have measurable outcomes

**Analysis**:
- Every functional requirement maps to success criteria:
  - FR-001, FR-002 â†’ SC-001 (100% timeout enforcement)
  - FR-003, FR-004 â†’ SC-002 (0 silent failures)
  - FR-005, FR-006 â†’ SC-003 (40-60% speedup)
  - FR-007 â†’ SC-004 (70% faster debugging)
  - FR-008, FR-009 â†’ SC-005 (real-time updates)
  - FR-010, FR-011 â†’ SC-006 (100% correlation accuracy)
  - FR-012, FR-013 â†’ SC-007 (80% fewer false failures)
  - FR-014, FR-015 â†’ SC-008 (100% constitution detection)
  - FR-016 â†’ SC-009 (50% fewer false positives)
  - FR-017 â†’ Implicit in SC-003 (serial fallback maintains speedup)

**Verification**:
- All 9 success criteria are quantifiable
- Baseline measurements implied (current state from Feature 001)
- Test procedures defined in user story acceptance scenarios

**Recommendation**: No action required

---

### ðŸŸ¢ PASS: Constitution Alignment

**Status**: Full compliance with all 8 principles

**Detailed Validation**:

| Principle | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|

| **II. Local-First CI/CD** | 100% local execution before push | âœ… PASS | All enhancements apply to local pipeline (scripts/local-ci/run.sh) |
| **III. Structured Observability** | JSON logging with timestamps | âœ… PASS | FR-007, FR-010, FR-011 (source context + correlation IDs) |
| **IV. Security by Default** | No secrets, pre-commit validation | âœ… PASS | FR-014, FR-015 (constitution file check maintains security posture) |
| **V. Test Coverage Completeness** | Unit + Integration + E2E tests | âœ… PASS | FR-005 (parallel execution), FR-012 (E2E retry logic) |
| **Performance Standards** | Pipeline < 5 minutes | âœ… PASS | FR-001 enforces 300-second limit (NFR-003) |
| **Deployment Standards** | Automatic rollback | âœ… PASS | FR-003, FR-004 (deployment state tracking) |
| **Developer Experience** | TUI simplicity | âœ… PASS | FR-008, FR-009 (real-time progress eliminates blank screen) |

**Recommendation**: No action required - full compliance achieved

---

### ðŸŸ¢ PASS: Coverage Gap Analysis

**Status**: 100% coverage - All requirements have tasks, all tasks map to requirements

**Requirement â†’ Task Mapping**:

| Requirement | User Story | Tasks | Coverage |
|-------------|-----------|-------|----------|
| FR-001 (Timeout enforcement) | US1 | T010, T011, T012 | âœ… 100% |
| FR-002 (Timeout logging) | US1 | T012, T014 | âœ… 100% |

| FR-010 (Correlation ID generation) | US6 | T034, T035, T036 | âœ… 100% |
| FR-011 (Correlation ID format) | US6 | T034 | âœ… 100% |
| FR-012 (E2E retry logic) | US7 | T045-T050 | âœ… 100% |
| FR-013 (E2E retry scope) | US7 | T045 (wrapper function) | âœ… 100% |

**Task â†’ Requirement Mapping** (Orphan Check):

- Phase 1 (T001-T004): Setup tasks (no direct FR mapping) - âœ… Valid
- Phase 2 (T005-T009): Foundational contracts - âœ… Maps to FR-001, FR-007, FR-010
- Phase 12 (T061-T073): Polish tasks - âœ… Cross-cutting, valid

**Recommendation**: No gaps found - proceed to implementation

---

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM: Inconsistency Detection

**Status**: 2 medium-priority documentation polish items

**Finding 1: Terminology Variation**

**Issue**: "Pipeline Run" entity uses multiple terms for the same concept
- spec.md: "Pipeline Run" (entity description)
- data-model.md: "Pipeline Run" (formal entity)
- tasks.md: "pipeline execution" (informal reference)
- research.md: "pipeline run" (lowercase)

**Impact**: Medium - could cause confusion when referencing entity vs. activity

**Recommendation**: Standardize to:
- **Entity**: "Pipeline Run" (capitalized, formal)
- **Activity**: "pipeline execution" (lowercase, informal)
- Update research.md to use "Pipeline Run entity" when referring to data model

**Finding 2: Exit Code Documentation Distribution**

**Issue**: Exit code contract appears in 3 files with slight variations:
- contracts/exit-codes.md: Full specification with precedence rules
- spec.md (FR-002): Brief mention of exit code 5
- research.md (Decision #1): Implementation details for timeout

**Impact**: Medium - potential inconsistency if one location is updated but not others

**Recommendation**: Establish single source of truth:
- contracts/exit-codes.md: Full canonical specification
- spec.md: Reference only ("see contracts/exit-codes.md")
- research.md: Implementation reference with link to contract

**Action**: Update cross-references in Phase 12 (T061-T063 documentation tasks)

## Entity Relationship Validation

### Data Model Consistency Check

**Entities Defined in data-model.md**:
1. Pipeline Run (attributes: run_id, start_time, end_time, duration, exit_code, profile, triggered_by, steps_completed)
2. Deployment State Record (attributes: deployment_id, timestamp, commit_sha, status, git_operations_attempts, error_message)
3. Log Entry (attributes: timestamp, level, message, run_id, source_file, line_number, function_name, step_name, duration_ms)
4. Test Execution (attributes: test_type, attempt_number, status, duration, failure_count, started_at, completed_at, run_in_parallel, fallback_to_serial)

**Validation Against spec.md Key Entities**:
- âœ… Pipeline Run: Matches spec.md entity description
- âœ… Deployment State Record: Matches spec.md entity description
- âœ… Log Entry: Matches spec.md entity description
- âœ… Test Execution: Matches spec.md entity description

**Validation Against Functional Requirements**:
- FR-010, FR-011 (Correlation ID) â†’ âœ… Pipeline Run.run_id format validated
- FR-007 (Source context) â†’ âœ… Log Entry includes source_file, line_number, function_name
- FR-003, FR-004 (Deployment retry) â†’ âœ… Deployment State Record includes git_operations_attempts
- FR-017 (Serial fallback) â†’ âœ… Test Execution includes fallback_to_serial attribute

**JSON Schema Validation**:
- contracts/log-schema.json â†’ âœ… Matches Log Entry entity
- contracts/deployment-state-schema.json â†’ âœ… Matches Deployment State Record entity

**Recommendation**: Entity model is fully consistent with requirements and contracts

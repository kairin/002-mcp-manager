# Tasks: CI/CD Pipeline Improvements (Feature 002)

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/specs/002-cicd-pipeline-enhancements/`
**Prerequisites**: spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (US1-US9) to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Tests are NOT included (infrastructure enhancement, not application development).

**Note**: This is an enhancement to Feature 001 (existing Local CI/CD pipeline). All changes maintain backwards compatibility.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1-US9)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Initialize branch and verify prerequisites

- [X] T001 Create feature branch `002-cicd-pipeline-enhancements` from main
- [X] T002 Verify bash version ‚â• 4.4 (`bash --version`)
- [X] T003 Verify `jq` is installed and accessible (`which jq`)
- [X] T004 Create contracts directory `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/specs/002-cicd-pipeline-enhancements/contracts/`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core contracts and data structures that MUST be complete before ANY user story implementation

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 Create exit code contract in `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/specs/002-cicd-pipeline-enhancements/contracts/exit-codes.md` with codes 0-5
- [X] T006 [P] Create enhanced JSON log schema in `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/specs/002-cicd-pipeline-enhancements/contracts/log-schema.json`
- [X] T007 [P] Create deployment state schema in `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/specs/002-cicd-pipeline-enhancements/contracts/deployment-state-schema.json`
- [X] T008 Add exit code constant `EXIT_TIMEOUT=5` to `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/scripts/local-ci/run.sh`
- [X] T009 Add `SECONDS` variable initialization at pipeline start in `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/scripts/local-ci/run.sh`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

- [X] T012 [US1] Implement timeout failure logic: exit with code 5 and log "Pipeline failed: duration exceeded NFR-003 limit (Xs)" in `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/scripts/local-ci/run.sh`
- [X] T013 [US1] Add exit code precedence logic: test failure (2) overrides timeout (5) when both occur in `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/scripts/local-ci/run.sh`
- [X] T014 [US1] Update help message to include exit code 5 documentation in `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/scripts/local-ci/run.sh`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **US1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - P1 priority, must complete first
- **US2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational - P1 priority, can run parallel with US1 (different files)
- **US3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 completion - needs timeout baseline before parallelization
- **US4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational - P2 priority, can run parallel with US3 (different files)
- **US6 (Phase 7)**: Depends on Foundational - P3 priority, can run parallel with US4 (different concerns)
- **US5 (Phase 8)**: Depends on US4 AND US6 completion - needs enhanced logs with correlation IDs
- **US7 (Phase 9)**: Depends on Foundational - P3 priority, independent
- **US8 (Phase 10)**: Depends on Foundational - P3 priority, independent
- **US9 (Phase 11)**: Depends on Foundational - P3 priority, independent, can run parallel with US7/US8
- **Polish (Phase 12)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### Critical Path (Sequential Dependencies)

```
Phase 1 (Setup)
  ‚Üì
Phase 2 (Foundational) ‚Üê BLOCKS ALL STORIES
  ‚Üì
Phase 3 (US1 - Timeout) ‚Üê P1, BLOCKS US3
  ‚Üì
Phase 5 (US3 - Parallel Tests) ‚Üê P2, depends on US1
```

### Parallel Opportunities (After Foundational Complete)

```
Parallel Branch 1:
  Phase 3 (US1) ‚Üí Phase 5 (US3)

Parallel Branch 2:
  Phase 4 (US2) [independent, P1]

Parallel Branch 3:
  Phase 6 (US4) + Phase 7 (US6) ‚Üí Phase 8 (US5)

Parallel Branch 4:
  Phase 9 (US7) [independent, P3]

Parallel Branch 5:
  Phase 10 (US8) [independent, P3]

Parallel Branch 6:
  Phase 11 (US9) [independent, P3]
```

### Within Each User Story

- P1 stories before P2 stories before P3 stories (priority order)
- US1 must complete before US3 (dependency)
- US4 + US6 must complete before US5 (dependency)
- All other stories are independent after Foundational phase

### Parallel Task Execution (Within Story)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T006, T007 can run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 6 (US4)**:
- T028, T029, T030, T031 can run in parallel (all in same file, but different functions)

**Phase 7 (US6)**:
- T034, T035 can run in parallel (different concerns)

**Phase 11 (US9)**:
- T057, T058 can run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 12 (Polish)**:
- T061, T062, T063 can run in parallel (different files)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (P1 Stories Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: US1 (Timeout enforcement)
4. Complete Phase 4: US2 (Deployment state tracking)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test P1 features independently
6. Deploy if ready - NFR-003 now enforced, deployment tracking reliable

### Incremental Delivery by Priority

1. **P1 Complete** (US1, US2) ‚Üí Foundation + Compliance ‚úì
2. **Add P2** (US3, US4, US5) ‚Üí Performance + Observability ‚úì
3. **Add P3** (US6, US7, US8, US9) ‚Üí Polish + Stability ‚úì

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers (after Foundational complete):

- **Developer A**: Phase 3 (US1) ‚Üí Phase 5 (US3)
- **Developer B**: Phase 4 (US2)
- **Developer C**: Phase 6 (US4) + Phase 7 (US6) ‚Üí Phase 8 (US5)
- **Developer D**: Phase 9 (US7) + Phase 10 (US8) + Phase 11 (US9)

---

## Validation Checkpoints

After each phase, verify:

- **Phase 3 (US1)**: Pipeline exits with code 5 at 300 seconds
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: Deployment workflow retries 3 times and fails on exhaustion
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: Test phase 40-60% faster, serial fallback works
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: All logs include source_file, line_number, function_name
- **Phase 7 (US6)**: All logs include unique run_id
- **Phase 8 (US5)**: TUI updates every 1-2 seconds with live progress
- **Phase 9 (US7)**: E2E tests retry once on failure
- **Phase 10 (US8)**: Constitution check warns if file missing
- **Phase 11 (US9)**: Integration tests use regex matchers

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story (US1-US9)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- No tests included (infrastructure enhancement, not application development)
- All changes maintain backwards compatibility with Feature 001
- Exit code precedence: Test failure (2) > Timeout (5)
- Constitution check is non-blocking (warning only)

---

**Task Count**: 73 tasks across 12 phases
**User Stories**: 9 (2 P1, 3 P2, 4 P3)
**Critical Path**: Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2 ‚Üí Phase 3 ‚Üí Phase 5
**Estimated Parallel Execution**: ~60% reduction in wall-clock time with 4 developers
**Status**: Ready for implementation via `/speckit.implement`

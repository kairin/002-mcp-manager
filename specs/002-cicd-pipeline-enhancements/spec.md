# Feature Specification: CI/CD Pipeline Improvements (Enhancement to Feature 001)

**Feature Branch**: `002-cicd-pipeline-enhancements`
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Feature: CI/CD Pipeline Improvements (Enhancement to Feature 001) - We need to improve the existing local CI/CD pipeline with 11 targeted enhancements across 4 priority levels: Compliance & Reliability (NFR-003 enforcement, deployment state persistence), Performance & UX (parallel test execution, structured error context, real-time TUI progress), Observability (correlation IDs, retry logic for flaky tests), and Polish (constitution file verification, integration test regex matchers)."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-20

- Q: How should the pipeline handle resource conflicts when tests run concurrently (e.g., port conflicts, file system locks)? → A: Serial fallback - On detecting port conflict or lock timeout, automatically fall back to running failed test suite serially, logging the fallback event

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Hard Failure on Timeout Violation (Priority: P1)

As a developer using the CI/CD pipeline, when my build exceeds the 5-minute timeout threshold (NFR-003), I need the pipeline to fail immediately with a clear error code (exit 5) so I know my changes violate performance requirements and can take corrective action before deployment.

**Why this priority**: This is P1 because it enforces a critical non-functional requirement (NFR-003) that was previously only logged as a warning. Silent violations could allow performance regressions to reach production, impacting user experience and system reliability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a pipeline that intentionally exceeds 5 minutes (e.g., add artificial sleep commands) and verifying it exits with code 5 and logs appropriate failure messages. Delivers immediate value by catching performance regressions during local development.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the pipeline is running, **When** total execution time reaches exactly 5 minutes (300 seconds), **Then** the pipeline immediately terminates with exit code 5 and logs "Pipeline failed: duration exceeded NFR-003 limit (300s)"
2. **Given** the pipeline completes successfully, **When** total duration is 299 seconds, **Then** the pipeline exits with code 0 (success) and logs completion without timeout warnings
3. **Given** the pipeline is running and other failures occur, **When** duration is 310 seconds AND tests fail, **Then** the pipeline exits with the test failure code (2) not timeout code, but logs both failures

### User Story 2 - Reliable Deployment State Tracking (Priority: P1)

As a DevOps engineer monitoring deployments, when the GitHub Actions workflow attempts to commit deployment state to the repository, I need the workflow to fail loudly with retries if git operations fail so that deployment tracking remains accurate and I'm immediately alerted to tracking issues.

**Why this priority**: This is P1 because silent failures in deployment state persistence (current "|| echo" pattern) could cause loss of critical rollback information, making it impossible to recover from failed deployments or track deployment history accurately.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating git push failures (e.g., insufficient permissions, network issues) and verifying the workflow retries 3 times and fails the entire deployment if all attempts fail. Delivers value by ensuring deployment audit trail is never silently lost.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a deployment completes successfully, **When** the first git commit attempt fails due to transient error, **Then** the workflow retries up to 2 more times (3 total attempts) before failing
2. **Given** deployment state commit is attempted, **When** all 3 git push attempts fail, **Then** the workflow fails with clear error message "Failed to persist deployment state after 3 attempts" and deployment is marked as failed
3. **Given** deployment state is being committed, **When** git operations succeed on retry attempt 2, **Then** the workflow logs "Deployment state persisted (attempt 2/3)" and continues successfully

---

### User Story 3 - Faster Pipeline Execution via Parallel Tests (Priority: P2)

As a developer running local CI/CD checks, when I execute the full test suite, I need unit, integration, and E2E tests to run in parallel (using background jobs) so my feedback loop is 40-60% faster and I can meet the NFR-003 5-minute limit more easily.

**Why this priority**: This is P2 because while critical for NFR-003 compliance and developer productivity, it depends on P1 timeout enforcement being in place first. Delivers significant time savings without changing test coverage or quality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring test phase duration before/after parallelization with a standard test suite, verifying 40-60% reduction. Delivers immediate value by reducing wait time for CI/CD feedback from ~3-4 minutes to ~2 minutes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the test phase begins with 30 unit tests (60s), 15 integration tests (90s), and 5 E2E tests (120s), **When** tests run in parallel, **Then** total test phase duration is approximately 120 seconds (longest running test) instead of 270 seconds sequential
2. **Given** parallel tests are running, **When** one test suite fails (e.g., integration tests), **Then** all parallel jobs continue running and the pipeline collects all failures before reporting
3. **Given** parallel tests complete, **When** multiple test suites have failures, **Then** the pipeline exits with appropriate code (2 for test failures) and logs show failures from all test types with clear separation
4. **Given** parallel tests encounter resource contention (port conflict or file lock timeout), **When** a test suite fails due to resource conflict, **Then** the pipeline automatically re-runs that test suite serially and logs "Falling back to serial execution for [test_type] due to resource contention"

---

### User Story 4 - Enhanced Log Context for Debugging (Priority: P2)

As a developer debugging pipeline failures, when I review JSON log entries, I need each entry to include source file, line number, and function name so I can quickly locate the exact code that logged the entry without searching through multiple files.

**Why this priority**: This is P2 because while it significantly improves debugging efficiency, it's an enhancement to existing logging rather than a critical functionality fix. Delivers value by reducing time to diagnose issues from minutes to seconds.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering various log events and verifying JSON entries include "source_file", "line_number", and "function_name" fields with accurate values. Delivers standalone value for any pipeline troubleshooting scenario.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the pipeline logs an error in logger.sh:145 from function `log_error`, **When** reviewing the JSON log, **Then** the entry contains `"source_file": "lib/logger.sh", "line_number": 145, "function_name": "log_error"`
2. **Given** multiple functions call the logging library, **When** logs are generated, **Then** each entry's source context accurately reflects the calling function (not the logging library itself)
3. **Given** a multi-step pipeline operation, **When** reviewing logs, **Then** I can trace the execution path through source files by following the source context fields

---

### User Story 5 - Real-Time TUI Progress Updates (Priority: P2)

As a developer using the TUI interface to run the CI/CD pipeline, when the pipeline executes, I need to see live progress updates parsed from JSON logs (e.g., "Running tests... 45%", "Linting complete ✓") so I know the pipeline is actively working instead of appearing frozen with a blank screen.

**Why this priority**: This is P2 because it addresses a significant UX issue without changing core functionality. The current blank screen during execution causes confusion about whether the pipeline is working or hung.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by launching the TUI, starting a pipeline run, and observing that progress updates appear in real-time (updating every 1-2 seconds) showing current step, percentage complete, and step status. Delivers immediate UX improvement for all TUI users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the TUI is running a full pipeline, **When** the lint step is executing, **Then** the TUI displays "Step 3/9: Linting code... 33%" with a progress indicator
2. **Given** a pipeline step completes successfully, **When** the TUI parses the completion log, **Then** the display updates to show "Step 3/9: Linting complete ✓ (12.5s)" in green
3. **Given** a pipeline step fails, **When** the TUI parses the failure log, **Then** the display shows "Step 4/9: Unit tests failed ✗ (see logs/ci-*.log)" in red and the pipeline continues or stops based on error handling rules

---

### User Story 6 - Pipeline Run Correlation for Tracing (Priority: P3)

As a developer analyzing multi-step pipeline executions, when I review logs from multiple concurrent or sequential runs, I need each run to have a unique correlation ID included in all log entries so I can trace individual runs through the system without confusion.

**Why this priority**: This is P3 because it's an observability enhancement valuable for debugging complex scenarios, but not critical for basic pipeline operation. Most beneficial when troubleshooting intermittent issues or analyzing patterns across multiple runs.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running multiple pipelines concurrently or sequentially, then verifying each log entry includes a unique "run_id" field (e.g., UUID or timestamp-based) that remains consistent throughout that run's lifecycle. Delivers value for any multi-run analysis scenario.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** two pipelines start simultaneously at 14:30:00, **When** both generate logs, **Then** all entries from run 1 share correlation ID "run-20251020-143000-abc123" and all entries from run 2 share "run-20251020-143000-def456"
2. **Given** a pipeline run with correlation ID "run-xyz", **When** searching logs for that ID, **Then** I can retrieve all log entries from that specific run across all pipeline steps
3. **Given** the TUI displays running pipelines, **When** showing status, **Then** each active pipeline displays its correlation ID for reference during log analysis

### User Story 7 - Automatic E2E Test Retry for Stability (Priority: P3)

As a developer whose E2E tests occasionally fail due to browser timing issues, when an E2E test fails on first attempt, I need the pipeline to automatically retry once (2 attempts total) so transient failures don't block my workflow while genuine failures are still caught.

**Why this priority**: This is P3 because it reduces false negatives from flaky E2E tests, but doesn't impact core CI/CD functionality. Most valuable for teams experiencing frequent transient E2E failures due to timing, network, or browser startup issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by introducing an E2E test that fails on first run but succeeds on second (e.g., using a toggle file), then verifying the pipeline retries automatically and reports success. Delivers value by reducing wasted developer time investigating false failures.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an E2E test suite fails on first attempt, **When** the failure is detected, **Then** the pipeline logs "E2E tests failed (attempt 1/2), retrying..." and re-runs the E2E tests
2. **Given** E2E tests fail on first attempt but pass on second, **When** retry completes, **Then** the pipeline logs "E2E tests passed (attempt 2/2)" and continues with success status
3. **Given** E2E tests fail on both attempts, **When** both retries are exhausted, **Then** the pipeline exits with code 2 (test failure) and logs "E2E tests failed after 2 attempts"

---

### User Story 8 - Constitution File Validation (Priority: P3)

As a developer using SpecKit with the CI/CD pipeline, when the environment check step runs, I need validation that `.specify/memory/constitution.md` exists so I'm alerted early if the project constitution is missing before proceeding with builds.

**Why this priority**: This is P3 because it's a polish feature that prevents downstream issues for SpecKit users, but doesn't impact core CI/CD for projects not using SpecKit. Adds minimal overhead and provides early validation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the env-check step with and without the constitution file present, verifying appropriate warning or error is logged. Delivers value for SpecKit-integrated projects by catching missing configuration early.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the env-check step runs, **When** `.specify/memory/constitution.md` exists, **Then** the validation logs "Constitution file: found ✓" and continues
2. **Given** the env-check step runs, **When** `.specify/memory/constitution.md` does not exist, **Then** the pipeline logs warning "Constitution file missing (optional for SpecKit projects)" and continues (non-blocking)
3. **Given** the project uses SpecKit features, **When** constitution file is missing, **Then** the warning includes a hint "Run /speckit.constitution to create"

---

### User Story 9 - Improved Integration Test Assertions (Priority: P3)

As a developer maintaining integration tests, when I write tests that match patterns or regular expressions, I need to use `.toMatch(/regex/)` instead of `.toContain('string')` so the tests are more robust and accurately validate expected patterns rather than simple substring matches.

**Why this priority**: This is P3 because it's a test quality improvement that reduces false positives but doesn't change pipeline behavior. Most valuable for teams with integration tests that currently have brittle string matching assertions.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by updating integration test files to use `.toMatch()` for pattern assertions, running the test suite, and verifying tests still pass with more precise pattern matching. Delivers value by making tests more maintainable and accurate.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an integration test validates function names in output, **When** using `.toMatch(/function:\s+\w+/)`, **Then** the test accurately matches the pattern and passes with valid output
2. **Given** an integration test previously used `.toContain('function:')`, **When** refactored to `.toMatch(/^function:\s+\w+$/)`, **Then** the test now correctly rejects malformed output that previously passed
3. **Given** integration tests use regex patterns, **When** test output format changes slightly (e.g., whitespace), **Then** tests remain stable because patterns account for flexibility

### Edge Cases

- **Resource contention during parallel tests**: When parallel test execution causes port conflicts or file system locks, the pipeline automatically falls back to running the affected test suite serially while logging the fallback event for diagnostic purposes
- How does the system handle correlation ID generation if the random/UUID generator fails or is unavailable?
- What occurs if the TUI is parsing logs but the JSON log format is corrupted or malformed?
- How does retry logic behave if E2E tests hang indefinitely instead of failing cleanly?
- What happens when deployment state commit fails due to authentication issues rather than transient network errors?
- How does the pipeline handle timeout enforcement if system clock changes during execution (e.g., NTP sync)?
- What occurs if structured error context (source file, line number) cannot be determined (e.g., called from shell eval)?
- How does real-time TUI progress handle very fast pipeline execution where steps complete in <1 second?

- **FR-012**: E2E test step MUST automatically retry once (2 attempts total) if initial execution fails, with clear logging of retry attempts
- **FR-013**: E2E retry logic MUST only apply to the E2E test step, not to unit or integration tests
- **FR-014**: Environment check step (env-check) MUST validate presence of `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file and log appropriate status (found/missing)
- **FR-015**: Constitution file check MUST be non-blocking (warning only), allowing pipeline to continue if file is missing

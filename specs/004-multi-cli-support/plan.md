# Implementation Plan: Project Health and Standardization Audit

**Branch**: `005-we-ve-gone` | **Date**: 2025-10-15 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/specs/005-we-ve-gone/spec.md`

## Summary

This feature is a technical debt and project health initiative to enforce development standards. The primary goals are to:
1.  Enforce that `uv` is the exclusive tool for Python package management.
2.  Update all project dependencies to their latest stable versions.
3.  Clean up the root directory by organizing files into appropriate subfolders.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: `uv`, `pydantic`, `typer`, `rich`, `astro`, `npm`
**Storage**: Filesystem (JSON for configurations, Markdown for documentation)
**Testing**: `pytest`
**Target Platform**: Linux CLI
**Project Type**: CLI tool with a web frontend for documentation.
**Performance Goals**: N/A (Internal project health feature)
**Constraints**: All Python operations must be executed via `uv`.
**Scale/Scope**: Project-wide audit and refactoring.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: This feature is designed to enforce the constitution. All checks are expected to pass.* 

- **I. Platform Agnosticism**: Does the design support Claude, Gemini, and Copilot CLI without manual changes? (✅ Yes, this standardizes the dev environment for all platforms.)
- **II. Configuration Correctness**: Are Pydantic models used to prevent invalid configurations? (✅ Yes, this effort reinforces the existing structure.)
- **III. Explicit Platform Support**: Is the platform compatibility matrix updated? (✅ N/A, no change to platform support.)
- **IV. Version-Specific Best Practices**: Does the plan use `@latest` for dev tools where appropriate? (✅ Yes, this is a core goal of the feature.)
- **V. Comprehensive Testing**: Does the plan include tests for all supported platforms? (✅ Yes, ensuring tests pass after dependency updates is a key requirement.)
- **VI. Backward Compatibility**: Is there a migration path for existing configurations? (✅ N/A, this is a dev environment change.)
- **VII. Developer Experience**: Is the workflow intuitive (e.g., single command setup)? (✅ Yes, the goal is to simplify and standardize the setup.)
- **VIII. Security by Default**: Are secrets handled via environment variables (no hardcoding)? (✅ Yes, this audit does not affect secret handling.)
- **IX. Observability**: Does the plan include logging and diagnostics? (✅ N/A, no change to observability.)

## Project Structure

No changes will be made to the overall project structure. This feature will involve auditing existing files and moving them if necessary, but the defined source code structure remains the same.

```
src/
├── mcp_manager/
└── ...
tests/
├── contract/
├── integration/
└── unit/
docs/
specs/
```

**Structure Decision**: The existing project structure is sound and will be adhered to.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitutional violations are anticipated. This feature is purely for alignment and cleanup.

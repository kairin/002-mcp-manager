**Status**: PRESERVED FOR REFERENCE ONLY

## Why Archived?

This feature specification is a **duplicate** of `001-system-python-enforcement`:

- **Feature 001 Created**: 2025-10-15 (one day later)
- **Feature 001 Status**: Newer, more refined with better clarifications

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Feature 003 (Older) | Feature 001 (Newer, Active) |

| Recommendation | ❌ Archived | ✅ Use this version |

## What Both Features Do

Both features implement **System Python 3.13 Enforcement**:
- Detect and validate system Python 3.13 installation
- Configure UV to use only system Python
- Prevent UV from downloading additional Python interpreters
- Provide `mcp-manager validate` command for compliance verification

## Active Feature Location

**Use Feature 001 instead**: `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/specs/001-system-python-enforcement/`

## Preservation Rationale

This directory is **preserved** (not deleted) for:
- Historical reference
- Comparison of specification evolution
- Verification that Feature 001 captures all requirements from Feature 003

**Do NOT implement this feature**. All development should use Feature 001.

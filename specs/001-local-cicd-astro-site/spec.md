# Feature Specification: Local CI/CD for Astro Site

**Feature Branch**: `001-local-cicd-astro-site`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Finalized
**Input**: User description: "i need the implementation to be modular, and more importantly, don't keep creating scripts to solve issues, and don't create unnecessary files that causes the folder to be crowded and lots of files that is hard to manage. i also want it to create an astro.build webpage using github pages, but i do not want to incur additional charges on github. can you implement something that ensures whenever commits are made, all ci/cd and all github runners are carried out locally before being pushed to the remote repo? so that the remote repo only needs to deploy the website without incurring too much actions that will incur additional charges? then the tui and all other scripts can make it modular so that it is simple and easy to maintain?"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-19
- Q: What should happen if the local CI/CD script fails? → A: The script should attempt to automatically fix the issues (e.g., run `prettier --write`).
- Q: How should the system handle different environments (local vs. production)? → A: Use different configuration files for each environment (e.g., `.env.local`, `.env.production`).
- Q: What types of tests should be included in the CI/CD pipeline? → A: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
- Q: What approach should the local CI/CD pipeline use for managing secrets and environment variables? → A: Use `.env` files with `.gitignore` patterns + validation step in pre-commit hook to block secrets
- Q: What level of logging and observability should the local CI/CD pipeline provide? → A: Structured - Show step-by-step progress with timestamps, warnings, and errors in machine-parseable format (JSON)
- Q: What should happen if the GitHub Pages deployment fails after a successful local CI/CD run? → A: Rollback automatically - Revert to last known good deployment and notify developer via email/log
- Q: What performance targets should the Astro website meet? → A: High - Page load < 1.5 seconds on 3G, Lighthouse Performance score > 90
- Q: What should be the PRIMARY architectural principle that governs this project? → A: Modular-First Design - Every feature must be independently buildable, testable, and deployable with clear separation of concerns


### User Story 1 - Local CI/CD Execution (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to run all CI/CD processes locally before pushing to the remote repository, so that I can avoid incurring additional charges on GitHub Actions.

**Why this priority**: This is the core requirement of the feature, aimed at cost-saving.

**Independent Test**: A developer can run a single command to execute the entire CI/CD pipeline locally. The output of the local run should be identical to what a GitHub Actions runner would produce.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a developer has made new commits, **When** they run the local CI/CD script, **Then** the script executes all necessary checks (e.g., linting, testing, building).
2.  **Given** the local CI/CD script has been run, **When** the code is pushed to the remote repository, **Then** no GitHub Actions are triggered for CI/CD, only for deployment.

### User Story 2 - Modular Implementation (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want the implementation to be modular, with a clear separation between the website, the TUI, and other scripts, so that the project is simple and easy to maintain.

**Why this priority**: This ensures the long-term health and maintainability of the project.

**Independent Test**: The website, TUI, and scripts can be developed and tested independently of each other.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the project structure, **When** a developer inspects the codebase, **Then** they can easily identify the separate modules for the website, TUI, and scripts.
2.  **Given** a change is made to the TUI, **When** the project is tested, **Then** the website and other scripts are not negatively affected.

### User Story 3 - Astro.build Website on GitHub Pages (Priority: P3)

As a project owner, I want to have a website built with Astro.build and hosted on GitHub Pages, so that I can have a fast and modern web presence for free.

**Why this priority**: This is the main user-facing output of the project.

**Independent Test**: The website can be built and deployed to GitHub Pages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the project is set up, **When** a developer pushes to the main branch, **Then** the Astro.build website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.
2.  **Given** the website is deployed, **When** a user visits the GitHub Pages URL, **Then** they can see the live website.

### Edge Cases

-   If the local CI/CD script fails, it should attempt to automatically fix the issues (e.g., run `prettier --write`). If it cannot fix the issues, it should exit with a non-zero exit code.
-   The system will handle different environments (local vs. production) using different configuration files (e.g., `.env.local`, `.env.production`).
-   If a developer attempts to commit files containing secrets or API keys, the pre-commit hook MUST block the commit and display an error message identifying the offending file(s).
-   If GitHub Pages deployment fails after a successful local CI/CD run, the system MUST automatically rollback to the last known good deployment and notify the developer via log file (and optionally email).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The system MUST use Astro.build for the website.
-   **FR-002**: The website MUST be deployable to GitHub Pages.
-   **FR-003**: The system MUST provide a script to run all CI/CD processes locally.
-   **FR-004**: The implementation MUST be modular, with a clear separation of concerns.
-   **FR-005**: The project MUST NOT contain unnecessary files.
-   **FR-006**: The system MUST include a Text-based User Interface (TUI) to make it easy when running the app, so that the options are available to user without having to remember flags and what functions or features of the app.
-   **FR-007**: The local CI/CD script MUST execute linting, testing, and building the Astro site for GitHub Pages.
-   **FR-008**: The modular implementation should be structured with separate folders for the website, TUI, and scripts, and be component-based with reusable modules.
-   **FR-009**: The system MUST use `.env` files with `.gitignore` patterns for secrets management and MUST include a pre-commit hook validation step to block accidental secrets commits.
-   **FR-010**: The local CI/CD script MUST provide structured logging with step-by-step progress, timestamps, warnings, and errors in machine-parseable format (JSON) to enable debugging and monitoring.
-   **FR-011**: The GitHub Pages deployment workflow MUST include automatic rollback capability to revert to the last known good deployment if deployment fails, with notification to the developer via log file.

### Non-Functional Requirements (Quality Attributes)

-   **NFR-001**: The Astro website MUST achieve a page load time of less than 1.5 seconds on 3G connections.
-   **NFR-002**: The Astro website MUST achieve a Lighthouse Performance score greater than 90.
-   **NFR-003**: The local CI/CD pipeline MUST complete all checks (linting, testing, building) in under 5 minutes for typical changes.

## Architectural Principles

This feature MUST comply with the project constitution defined in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

**Primary Principle**: Modular-First Design - Every feature must be independently buildable, testable, and deployable with clear separation of concerns.

**Key Compliance Requirements**:
- Local-First CI/CD execution (100% local before push)
- Structured observability (JSON logging with timestamps)
- Security by default (pre-commit secret validation)
- Test coverage completeness (unit, integration, e2e)
- Performance standards (page load < 1.5s, Lighthouse > 90)

## Assumptions

-   The user has a GitHub account and is familiar with GitHub Pages.
-   The user has Node.js and npm (or a similar package manager) installed on their local machine.
-   The "testing" in the CI/CD process refers to unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: 100% of CI/CD tasks are executed locally before code is pushed to the remote repository.
-   **SC-002**: GitHub Actions usage for CI/CD is reduced to zero, with actions only used for deployment.
-   **SC-003**: A developer can set up and run the entire local CI/CD pipeline in under 10 minutes.
-   **SC-004**: The project structure is clear and well-documented, allowing a new developer to understand the different modules within 30 minutes.
-   **SC-005**: The deployed Astro website achieves page load times under 1.5 seconds on 3G connections in 95% of tested scenarios.
-   **SC-006**: The deployed Astro website achieves a Lighthouse Performance score of 90 or higher.

3. **US3 (P3)**: Astro Website + GitHub Pages Deployment

---

## Phase 1: Repository Cleanup & Setup

**Goal**: Fix 7 critical repository issues identified in CRITICAL_ISSUES.md

**Independent Test**: Repository structure matches plan.md, no unnecessary files, all `.env` templates exist

### Cleanup Tasks (Critical Issues #3, #4, #5):

- [ ] T001 Remove redundant `web/web/` directory: `rm -rf /home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/web/web/`
- [ ] T002 Move test files from `web/src/tests/` to `web/tests/unit/`: `mv web/src/tests/*.test.js web/tests/unit/`
- [ ] T003 Remove empty `web/src/tests/` directory: `rmdir /home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/web/src/tests/`

### Environment Configuration:

- [ ] T004 Create `.env.example` at `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/.env.example` with template values from data-model.md Entity 2
- [ ] T005 [P] Create `.env.local` at `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/.env.local` with development settings (NODE_ENV=development)
- [ ] T006 [P] Create `.env.production` at `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/.env.production` with production settings

---

## Phase 2: Foundational Infrastructure (Security & Logging)

**Goal**: Implement pre-commit hooks (Critical Issue #2) and JSON logging library (Critical Issue #1 foundation)

**Independent Test**: Pre-commit hook blocks secrets, logger library produces valid JSON

### Pre-Commit Hook Setup (Critical Issue #2):

- [ ] T009 Install Husky and lint-staged: `cd web && npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged`
- [ ] T010 Initialize Husky: `cd web && npx husky init`
- [ ] T011 Install Gitleaks binary for secret detection (macOS: `brew install gitleaks`, Linux: download from releases)
- [ ] T012 Configure lint-staged in `web/package.json` with Gitleaks command per research.md
- [ ] T013 Create pre-commit hook at `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/.husky/pre-commit` calling `npx lint-staged`
- [ ] T014 Test pre-commit hook by staging file with fake secret pattern (should block commit)

### JSON Logging Library (Critical Issue #1 - Part 1):

- [ ] T015 [P] Create logger library at `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/scripts/local-ci/lib/logger.sh` with jq-based functions per research.md
- [ ] T016 [P] Implement `log_json()` function in logger.sh with timestamp, level, step, message parameters
- [ ] T017 [P] Create unit tests for logger at `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/scripts/local-ci/lib/logger.test.sh`
- [ ] T018 [P] Create validator library at `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/scripts/local-ci/lib/validator.sh` with secret patterns from data-model.md Entity 2
- [ ] T019 [P] Create cleanup script at `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/scripts/local-ci/lib/cleanup-logs.sh` with 30-day retention logic

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Local CI/CD Execution (P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: As a developer, I want to run all CI/CD processes locally before pushing to the remote repository, so that I can avoid incurring additional charges on GitHub Actions.

**Independent Test**: Developer runs `./scripts/local-ci/run.sh` â†’ all checks execute with JSON logging â†’ exit code 0 if success

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. âœ… Developer runs local CI/CD script â†’ linting, testing, building all execute
2. âœ… Lint failure triggers auto-fix attempt before failing
3. âœ… Push to remote after local CI pass â†’ no GitHub Actions CI/CD triggered

### US1: Rewrite CI/CD Script (Critical Issue #1):

- [ ] T021 [US1] Rewrite run.sh header with proper shebang, error handling (`set -euo pipefail`), and logger import
- [ ] T022 [US1] Implement init step in run.sh: log start, set LOG_FILE variable, create log directory
- [ ] T023 [US1] Implement env-check step: validate bash, jq, node, npm versions per Technical Context requirements
- [ ] T024 [US1] Implement lint step with auto-fix: run prettier --check, if fail run prettier --write, re-run check
- [ ] T025 [US1] Implement test-unit step: run `cd web && npx mocha tests/unit/**/*.test.js` with output capture
- [ ] T026 [US1] Implement test-integration step: run `cd web && npx mocha tests/integration/**/*.integration.test.js`
- [ ] T027 [US1] Implement test-e2e step: run `cd web && npx playwright test tests/e2e/` with browser installation check
- [ ] T028 [US1] Implement build step: run `cd web && npm run build`, verify `web/dist/` created, check size
- [ ] T029 [US1] Implement cleanup step: call cleanup-logs.sh to remove logs older than 30 days
- [ ] T030 [US1] Implement complete step: output final summary JSON with metrics per data-model.md Entity 3

### US1: Error Handling & CLI Options:

- [ ] T031 [US1] Add error handling for all steps with proper exit codes: 0=success, 1=lint, 2=test, 3=build, 4=env
- [ ] T032 [US1] Add SIGINT (Ctrl+C) handler for graceful abortion with exit code 130
- [ ] T033 [US1] Implement `--no-fix` flag to skip auto-fix attempts on lint failure
- [ ] T034 [US1] Implement `--verbose` flag to show full command output (not just JSON logs)

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Modular Implementation (P2)

**Goal**: As a developer, I want the implementation to be modular, with clear separation between the website, TUI, and scripts, so that the project is simple and easy to maintain.

**Independent Test**: TUI runs independently, website tests don't depend on CI, changes to one module don't break others

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. âœ… TUI provides interactive menu for CI/CD operations

- [ ] T047 [US2] Implement "View Logs" option: list log files in `logs/`, let user select, display with `cat log | jq .`
- [ ] T048 [US2] Implement "Setup" option: guide user through creating `.env.local` file interactively
- [ ] T049 [US2] Implement "Help" option: display content from `../../specs/001-local-cicd-astro-site/quickstart.md`
- [ ] T050 [US2] Add error handling for user cancellation (ESC key) and invalid selections
- [ ] T051 [US2] Update `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/scripts/tui/README.md` with TUI usage instructions

### US2: Module Independence Verification:

- [ ] T052 [US2] Create integration test at `web/tests/integration/module-independence.test.js` verifying no cross-module imports
- [ ] T053 [US2] Document module boundaries in `/home/kkk/Apps/002-mcp-manager/scripts/README.md` per contracts/ci-script.contract.md
- [ ] T054 [US2] Update root `README.md` with module overview diagram showing web/, scripts/tui/, scripts/local-ci/ separation

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Astro Website + GitHub Pages (P3)

**Goal**: As a project owner, I want a website built with Astro.build and hosted on GitHub Pages, so that I can have a fast and modern web presence for free.

**Independent Test**: Website builds successfully, deploys to GitHub Pages, rolls back on failure, meets performance targets

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. âœ… Push to main â†’ website deploys to GitHub Pages (no CI/CD on remote)
2. âœ… Website loads in < 1.5s on 3G (NFR-001)
3. âœ… Lighthouse Performance score > 90 (NFR-002)

- [ ] T057 [US3] Add checkout step with `actions/checkout@v4`
- [ ] T058 [US3] Add deployment step: configure GitHub Pages to serve from `web/dist/` (pre-built locally)
- [ ] T059 [US3] Implement rollback logic: store last deployment ID in artifact, rollback on failure per data-model.md Entity 4
- [ ] T060 [US3] Add Lighthouse CI step: run `npx @lhci/cli@0.13.x autorun` to validate NFR-001, NFR-002
- [ ] T061 [US3] Add deployment state tracking: upload deployment metadata to GitHub Actions artifacts
- [ ] T062 [US3] Add notification step: log deployment status, send notification on rollback

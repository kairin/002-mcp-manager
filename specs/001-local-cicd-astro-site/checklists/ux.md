# UX Requirements Checklist

**Purpose**: To validate the user experience aspects of the feature requirements.
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Updated**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Clarity & Simplicity

- [DEFERRED] CHK001 Are the requirements for the TUI clear and easy to understand? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]
  - ⏳ **PHASE 4**: TUI module not yet implemented (T050-T063 pending)
  - 📋 **PLANNED**: Interactive menu with numbered options (see tasks.md Phase 4)
  - 📋 **DESIGN**: 9 menu options planned (run CI/CD, view logs, check env, help, exit)

- [DEFERRED] CHK002 Is the purpose of each option in the TUI clearly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]
  - ⏳ **PHASE 4**: TUI module not yet implemented
  - 📋 **PLANNED**: Each menu option will have clear description
  - 📋 **REFERENCE**: See `scripts/mcp/mcp-profile` for working TUI example (7 options with descriptions)

- [DEFERRED] CHK003 Is the website navigation intuitive and easy to use? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001]
  - ⏳ **PHASE 5**: Website not yet deployed (T064-T069 pending)
  - 📋 **PLANNED**: Static Astro.build site with simple navigation
  - 📋 **REQUIREMENT**: Lighthouse Performance score > 90 (NFR-002)

## Consistency

- [DEFERRED] CHK004 Are the UI components used consistently across the website? [Consistency, Spec §FR-001]
  - ⏳ **PHASE 5**: Website not yet implemented
  - 📋 **PLANNED**: Astro components for consistency
  - 📋 **REFERENCE**: See `web/src/components/` for component structure

- [X] CHK005 Is the terminology used in the TUI and the website consistent? [Consistency]
  - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Consistent terminology across all scripts:
    - "CI/CD pipeline" used consistently in run.sh, tasks.md, spec.md
    - "Lint", "Test", "Build" steps named consistently
    - Exit codes documented consistently (0=success, 1=lint, 2=test, 3=build, 4=env)
    - JSON log schema consistent across all steps (timestamp, level, step, message)

## Feedback & Error Handling

- [X] CHK006 Does the TUI provide clear feedback to the user after each action? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006]
  - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: CI/CD script provides comprehensive feedback:
    - **JSON structured logging**: Every step outputs timestamped JSON (FR-010)
    - **Duration tracking**: Each step reports execution time
    - **Success/failure indicators**: `level: "success"` or `level: "error"`
    - **Progress visibility**: Step-by-step output (init → env-check → lint → test → build → cleanup → complete)
    - **Final summary**: Complete step outputs total duration with 5-minute warning
  - ⏳ **PHASE 4**: TUI will enhance this with interactive menu feedback

- [X] CHK007 Are error messages in the TUI and the website clear and helpful? [Clarity]
  - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: CI/CD script error messages are clear and actionable:
    - **Unknown options**: "Unknown option: $1" + shows help
    - **Validation errors**: "ERROR: bash version 5.0 < 5.2 (required)"
    - **Lint failures**: "Linting failed (auto-fix disabled)" with exit code 1
    - **Test failures**: "Unit tests failed" with exit code 2, duration logged
    - **Build failures**: "Build succeeded but dist/ directory not found" with specific error
    - **Exit code documentation**: `--help` shows all exit codes and meanings
  - ⏳ **PHASE 4-5**: TUI and website will maintain this error clarity

## Accessibility

- [DEFERRED] CHK008 Are accessibility requirements specified for the website? [Gap]
  - ⏳ **PHASE 5**: Website not yet implemented
  - 📋 **TO ADD**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance requirements
  - 📋 **TO ADD**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, color contrast requirements
  - 📋 **RECOMMENDATION**: Add accessibility checklist before Phase 5 implementation

- [DEFERRED] CHK009 Is the website navigable using only a keyboard? [Gap]
  - ⏳ **PHASE 5**: Website not yet implemented
  - 📋 **TO ADD**: Keyboard navigation requirements (Tab, Enter, Esc)
  - 📋 **TO ADD**: Focus indicators, skip links, logical tab order
  - 📋 **RECOMMENDATION**: Test with keyboard-only navigation during Phase 5

## UX Implementation Summary for Completed Phases

**✅ 2/9 Checks Passed (MVP Scope)**
**⏳ 7/9 Checks Deferred to Phase 4-5**

**Current UX Features (CI/CD Script)**:
- ✅ Clear help documentation (`--help` flag)
- ✅ Structured JSON logging for programmatic parsing
- ✅ Human-readable messages in logs
- ✅ Consistent terminology and exit codes
- ✅ Comprehensive error messages with solutions
- ✅ Duration tracking and warnings
- ✅ Step-by-step progress visibility

**Pending UX Features**:
- ⏳ TUI interactive menu (Phase 4, T050-T063)
- ⏳ Website navigation (Phase 5, T064-T069)
- ⏳ Website accessibility (Phase 5, requires spec update)

**Recommendation**:
- Defer CHK008-CHK009 to new accessibility checklist for Phase 5
- Current MVP (Phases 1-3) has strong UX for CLI users
- Phase 4 TUI will address CHK001-CHK002
- Phase 5 website will address CHK003-CHK004, CHK008-CHK009

**UX Compliance**: FR-006 (TUI requirement) pending Phase 4 implementation. Current CLI UX exceeds expectations with structured logging and comprehensive error handling.

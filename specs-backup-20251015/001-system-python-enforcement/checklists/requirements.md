# Specification Quality Checklist: System Python Enforcement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASS

All checklist items have been validated:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification is written in user-centric language focusing on "what" and "why" without implementation details. All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Constraints) are complete.

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - All 10 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) are testable and unambiguous
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
   - Success criteria use measurable metrics (percentages, time limits, counts)
   - Edge cases cover critical scenarios (missing Python, multiple installations, venv usage)
   - Scope is clearly bounded with explicit "Out of Scope" section
   - Dependencies and assumptions documented

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - 4 prioritized user stories (2 P1, 1 P2, 1 P3) with independent test scenarios
   - Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format
   - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "All mcp-manager CLI commands execute using system Python 3.13" instead of "Python executable path in config file")
   - No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` commands.

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories with P1 items focused on core functionality
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Measurable success criteria with specific percentages and time limits
- Well-defined constraints prevent scope creep

**Next Steps**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation design.
